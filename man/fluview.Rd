\usage{
fluview(
  epiweeks = "202016",
  regions = "flusight_state",
  lag = 0,
  issue = NULL,
  query = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{epiweeks}{String specifying epiweeks for which to request data.
Epiweeks must be in the form YYYYUU. Use two epiweeks separated by "-" to
obtain data from a range of time values. Request data from multiple time
values by concatenating them using "," as a separator.}

\item{regions}{String specifying regions for which to request data. Regions
identifiers must be those used by the API or \code{flusight_state} or
\code{flusight} which gives sets of regions that are included in those
competitions.}

\item{lag}{String specifying the number of weeks after the requested epiweek
to use as the issue week.  The issue week is the week at which the data are
considered up-to-date. In other words, all revisions of the data up to that
week are applied.}

\item{query}{String with query for API that overides other arguments if
provided.}

\item{issues}{String specifying the issue of the data to request which is an
alternative to lag, and overides it if present. \code{issue} = \code{lag} +
\code{epiweek}.}
}
\value{
An S3 object which is simply a list which has its own print method.
The list's elements are:
\describe{
\item{epidata}{a data frame with rows containing elements of the
epidata list returned from the API}
\item{url}{the URL used in the API request}
\item{response}{the full response.}
}
}
\description{
\code{fluview} provides an interface to the API documented at
\url{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/fluview.html}.
There is a simple R script available in the delphi-epidata git repository
which also can be used to access the API in R.
